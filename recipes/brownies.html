        <div class="lists">
            <ul>
                <li>1 (15.5 ounce) box strawberry cake mix</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>

                <li>1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, or more as needed</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="lists"></div>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix cake mix, melted butter, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined. Spread mixture into an even layer in the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow brownies to cool in the pan for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, puree strawberries and remaining teaspoon of vanilla extract in a food processor or with an immersion blender until smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir strawberry mixture into confectionerâ€™s sugar until smooth, adding extra sugar as necessary to reach the consistency of a glaze. Add salt and stir. </li>
            <li>Spread strawberry glaze evenly over the cooled brownies and let stand until completely cooled.  Cut into 12 squares, or refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
